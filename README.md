# Edge Impulse Example: stand-alone inferencing (C)

This builds and runs an exported impulse locally on your machine. It compiles the inferencing library, and then links it to a C application. See the documentation at [Running your impulse locally](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/running-your-impulse-locally). There is also a [C++ version](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/example-standalone-inferencing) of this application.
